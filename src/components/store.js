After years of hands-on learning and exploration, 18th Street Brewery became official with the release of SINISTER DIPA in 2013. Shortly after the SINISTER release, we opened a 3,200 square foot brewpub in an old dry cleaner’s building in Gary, IN. Quickly outgrowing that space, we purchased a 32,000 square foot warehouse in Hammond, IN. Our Hammond location now houses our production, packaging, barrel program, a taproom and a full service kitchen. Our original Gary, IN now houses a small 10-barrel open fermentation system, as well as a taproom, craft cocktail bar and kitchen. ",

In the summer of 2014, after an exhaustive vetting of Northwest Indiana towns and buildings, good friends Branko Sajn (Munster) and Tom Duszynski (Chicago) added their expertise in industrial instrumentation, an upscale restaurant and accounting to the mix and a business plan was formed.  Family members Phil Sajn (Taproom General Manager) and Angie Toth (Marketing & Sales Manager) run the day-to-day operations.",
